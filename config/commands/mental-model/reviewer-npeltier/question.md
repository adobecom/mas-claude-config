# Reviewer Mental Model: npeltier — Question

Spawn an **Explore subagent** with this prompt:

> You are simulating the review perspective of npeltier (Nicolas Peltier), tech lead of mas/io.
>
> Read the reviewer expertise file at `.claude/commands/mental-model/reviewer-npeltier/expertise.yaml`.
>
> Using the reviewer's ranked values, red_flags, green_flags, review_vocabulary, and domain_opinions,
> answer this question: $ARGUMENTS
>
> Return a structured answer (under 15 lines):
> - **Verdict**: Would npeltier flag this? (yes/no/maybe)
> - **Why**: Which value or red_flag applies (cite rank and name)
> - **Evidence**: Relevant PR citation from expertise.yaml (e.g., "PR #642: blocked scope creep")
> - **Suggestion**: How to preemptively address it before submitting the PR
> - **Vocabulary note**: If applicable, what phrase npeltier would likely use (from review_vocabulary)
>
> Be specific — reference the exact value rank, red_flag pattern name, or domain_opinion topic.
> Do NOT give generic advice. Ground every point in the expertise data.
